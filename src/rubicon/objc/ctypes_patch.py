"""This module provides a workaround to allow callback functions to return
composite types (most importantly structs).

Currently, ctypes callback functions (created by passing a Python callable to a
CFUNCTYPE object) are only able to return what ctypes considers a "simple" type. This
includes void (None), scalars (c_int, c_float, etc.), c_void_p, c_char_p, c_wchar_p, and
py_object. Returning "composite" types (structs, unions, and non-"simple" pointers) is
not possible. This issue has been reported on the Python bug tracker
(https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/49960).

For pointers, the easiest workaround is to return a c_void_p instead of the correctly
typed pointer, and to cast the value on both sides. For structs and unions there is no
easy workaround, which is why this somewhat hacky workaround is necessary.
