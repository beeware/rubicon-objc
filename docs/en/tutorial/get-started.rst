Getting Started with Rubicon
============================

To use Rubicon, create a new virtual environment, and install it:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ pip install rubicon-objc

You're now ready to use Rubicon! Your next step is to work through the
:doc:`/tutorial/index`, which will take you step-by-step through your first
steps and introduce you to the important concepts you need to become familiar
with.
