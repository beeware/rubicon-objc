# Rubicon Objective-C

Rubicon Objective-C is a bridge between Objective-C and Python. It
enables you to:

- Use Python to instantiate objects defined in Objective-C,
- Use Python to invoke methods on objects defined in Objective-C, and
- Subclass and extend Objective-C classes in Python.

It also includes wrappers of some key data types from the Foundation
framework (e.g., `NSString`).
