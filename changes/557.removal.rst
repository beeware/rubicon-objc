Python 3.14 deprecated the use of custom event loop policies, in favor of directly instantiating event loops. Instead of calling ``asyncio.new_event_loop()`` after installing an instance of ``rubicon.objc.eventloop.EventLoopPolicy``, you can call ``RubiconEventLoop()`` to instantiate an instance of an event loop and use that instance directly. This approach can be used on all versions of Python; on Python 3.13 and earlier, ``RubiconEventLoop()`` is a shim that performs the older event loop policy-based instantiation.
