Retain Objective-C objects when creating Python wrappers and release them when the
Python wrapped is garbage collected. This means that manual ``retain`` calls and
subsequent ``release`` or ``autorelease`` calls from Python are no longer needed with
very few exceptions such as:

1. When implementing methods like ``copy`` that are supposed to create an object, if
   the returned object is not actually newly created.
2. When dealing with side effects of methods like ``init`` that may release an object
   which is still referenced from Python. See for example
   https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2468.
