Retain Objective-C objects when creating Python wrappers and release them when the
Python wrapped is garbage collected. This means that manual ``retain`` calls and
subsequent ``release`` or ``autorelease`` calls from Python are no longer needed with
very few exceptions, for example when writing implementations of ``copy`` that return an
existing object.
