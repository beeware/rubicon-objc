Manual calls to ``release`` or ``autorelease`` no longer cause Rubicon
to skip releasing an Objective-C object when its Python wrapper is
garbage collected. This means that fewer ``retain`` than ``release`` calls will cause
segfaults on garbage collection. Review your code carefully for unbalanced ``retain``
and ``release`` calls before updating.
