# Import commonly used submodules right away.
# The first few imports are only included for clarity. They are not strictly necessary, because the from-imports below
# also import the types and runtime modules and implicitly add them to the rubicon.objc namespace.

# The import of collections is important, however. The classes from collections are not meant to be used directly,
# instead they are registered with the runtime module (using the for_objcclass decorator) so they are used in place of
# ObjCInstance when representing Foundation collections in Python. If this module is not imported, the registration
# will not take place, and Foundation collections will not support the expected methods/operators in Python!
