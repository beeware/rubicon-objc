    # Note: The ordering of the environments is optimized so that the complete matrix runs as quickly as possible,
    # while also providing the first results as early as possible.
    # At the moment, build times for each environment are roughly as follows:
    # xcode6.4: 13 minutes
    # xcode7.3: 5 minutes
    # xcode8.3: 3 minutes
    # xcode9.2: 2 minutes
    # This data is based on the following build, which should be similar to most builds on the repo:
    # https://travis-ci.org/pybee/rubicon-objc/builds/348992202
    # Currently, Travis allows a maximum of two concurrent Mac builds per owner:
    # https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-09-22-macos-update
    # With the following order, xcode6.4 will take up the first slot, and at the same time the three other
    # environments use the second slot in sequence. xcode9.2 will finish first and provide some early results - most
    # test failures happen in all environments and will be quickly reported this way.
