Rubicon-ObjC is a bridge between Objective-C and Python. It enables you to:

* Use Python to instantiate objects defined in Objective-C,
* Use Python to invoke methods on objects defined in Objective-C, and
* Subclass and extend Objective-C classes in Python.

It also includes wrappers of the some key data types from the Foundation
framework (e.g., ``NSString``).

Quickstart
----------

Rubicon uses a combination of ``ctypes``, plus Objective-C's own reflection
APIs, to enable Objective-C objects to be referenced in a Python process.

To install Rubicon, use pip::

    $ pip install rubicon-objc

Then, in a Python shell

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from ctypes import cdll
    >>> from ctypes import util
    >>> from rubicon.objc import ObjCClass, NSObject, objc_method

    # Use ctypes to import a framework into the Python process
    >>> cdll.LoadLibrary(util.find_library("Foundation"))

    # Wrap an Objective-C class contained in the framework
    >>> NSURL = ObjCClass("NSURL")
    >>> NSObject = ObjCClass("NSObject")

    # Then instantiate the Objective-C class, using the API
    # that is exposed through Objective-C. The Python method name
    # is the Objective-C method descriptor, up to the first colon.
    # The first argument (if it exists) is passed in as is; subsequent
    # arguments are passed in as keyword arguments. Properties can be
    # accessed and modified directly. So, the equivalent of:
    # NSURL *base = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://pybee.org"];
    # NSURL *full = [NSURL URLWithString:@"contributing/" relativeToURL:base];
    # NSLog(@"absoluteURL = %@", [full absoluteURL]);
    # would be:
    >>> base = NSURL.URLWithString("http://pybee.org/")
    >>> full = NSURL.URLWithString("http://pybee.org/", relativeToURL=base)
    >>> print("absoluteURL = %s" % full.absoluteURL)

    # Sometimes, a method will use have the same keyword argument name twice.
    # This is legal in Objective-C, but not in Python; in this case, you can
    # explicitly name a descriptor by replacing colons with underscores:
    >>> base = NSURL.URLWithString_("http://pybee.org/")
    >>> full = NSURL.URLWithString_relativeToURL_("http://pybee.org/", base)
    >>> print("absoluteURL = %s" % full.absoluteURL)

    # To create a new Objective-C class, define a Python class that
    # has the methods you want to define, decorate it to indicate that it
    # should be exposed to the Objective-C runtime, and annotate it to
    # describe the type of any arguments that aren't of type ``id``:
    >>> class Handler(NSObject):
    ...     @objc_method
    ...     def initWithValue_(self, v: int):
    ...         self.value = v
    ...         return self
    ...
    ...     @objc_method
    ...     def pokeWithValue_(self, v: int) -> None:
    ...         print("Poking with", v)
    ...         print("Internal value is", self.value)

    # Then use the class:
    >>> my_handler = Handler.alloc().initWithValue_(42)
    >>> my_handler.pokeWithValue_(37)

Testing
-------

To run the Rubicon test suite:

1. Compile the Rubicon test library. A ``Makefile`` has been provided to make
   this easy. Type::

       $ make

   to compile it.

   .. admonition:: Cross platform support

       This Makefile currently only works under OS X; however, the build commands
       aren't complicated; it should be fairly easy to reproduce the build on other
       platforms. Pull requests to make the ``Makefile`` cross-platform are welcome.

2. Put the Rubicon support library somewhere that it will be found by dynamic
   library discovery. This means:

   a. Under OS X, put the ``tests/objc`` directory in your ``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH``

   b. Under Linux, put the ``tests/objc`` directory in your ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``

   c. Under Windows... something :-)

3. Run the test suite::

       $ python setup.py test

   A ``tox`` configuration has also been provided; to run the tests across all
   supported platforms, run::

       $ tox
