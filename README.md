Rubicon-ObjC is a bridge between Objective-C and Python. It enables you to:

- Use Python to instantiate objects defined in Objective-C,
- Use Python to invoke methods on objects defined in Objective-C, and
- Subclass and extend Objective-C classes in Python.

It also includes wrappers of the some key data types from the Foundation framework (e.g., `NSString`).
